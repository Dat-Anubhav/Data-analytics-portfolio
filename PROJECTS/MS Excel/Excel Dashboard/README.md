Production Performance & Cost Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview:-

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of manufacturing data to evaluate production efficiency, labor distribution, and cost management. By transforming raw production logs into an interactive dashboard, this tool provides stakeholders with a clear view of where capital is being spent and how the workforce is being utilized.

Technical Implementation
    
    (i)	Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to handle missing values and "Unknown" data points.
    
    (ii)	Age Grouping: Applied Excel formulas to segment the workforce into Age Groups (A1, A2, A3) to analyze demographic performance trends.

    (iii)	Data Modeling: Established a flat-file schema for efficient Pivot Table processing.

    (iv)	Visualization: * Cost Analysis: Pie and Column charts to visualize total vs. average unit costs.
	
          (a) Efficiency Tracking: Line charts to monitor daily production volume (UnitsProduced).

          (b) Manager Leaderboard: Bar charts to track the number of tasks completed per supervisor.

Key Insights & Business Impact

    •	Cost Outlier: Identified that Furniture production is the most expensive at $180.44/unit, significantly higher than Electronics ($108.37/unit).

    •	Operational Risk: Analysis revealed that Nancy Grey oversees 37 tasks, while the next highest manager handles only 18. This indicates a high risk of burnout and potential quality issues.

    •	Volume Trends: Detected seasonal spikes in production volume, allowing for better inventory planning.

Recommendations
    
    1.	Process Audit: Conduct a deep dive into the Furniture manufacturing line to reduce the high per-unit cost.

    2.	Workload Balancing: Redistribute tasks from high-volume managers (Nancy Grey) to underutilized managers (Sarah Lee, 5 tasks) to optimize team efficiency.
