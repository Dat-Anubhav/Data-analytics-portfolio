Flight Price Feature Engineering Project

This project focuses on the comprehensive end-to-end feature engineering of a flight price dataset. The goal was to transform raw aviation data into a clean, structured, and fully encoded format ready for machine learning regression models.

Project Overview:-

The dataset contains over 10,000 records of flight information, including airline details, journey dates, routes, and pricing. The primary objective was to perform advanced data cleaning and feature transformation to prepare the data for price prediction.

Key Technical Steps

    •	Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized data types across 10,683 rows.
    
    •	Temporal Feature Extraction: Derived meaningful features from the "Date of Journey," "Departure Time," and "Arrival Time" columns to capture seasonal and time-of-day trends.

    •	Categorical Encoding: Implemented encoding strategies for features such as Airline, Source, and Destination to convert qualitative data into numerical formats.

    •	Route and Duration Processing: Cleaned and transformed the "Route" and "Total Duration" features into quantitative variables suitable for model input.
    
    •	Final Pre-processing: Conducted final checks to ensure the dataset had zero missing values and a consistent structure across all 23 resulting columns.

Technical Stack

    •	Language: Python

    •	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

    •	Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Deliverables
    
    •	Machine Learning Ready Dataset: A processed dataset with 10k+ clean rows and all features encoded.

    •	Analysis Workflow: A step-by-step Jupyter Notebook documenting the transition from raw data to a model-ready state.

Project Structure
    
    •	End-to-end-Feature-engineering-on-flight-price-dataset.ipynb: The complete Python notebook containing the data processing logic and feature engineering pipeline.

Project Purpose:-

This repository demonstrates technical proficiency in data pre-processing, feature engineering, and preparing complex datasets for predictive modeling.
