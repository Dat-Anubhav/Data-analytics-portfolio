# Data Analytics and Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository. This project is a comprehensive record of my 90+ day intensive journey into Data Analytics. It serves as a central hub for my daily progress, technical exercises, and end-to-end projects.

# Overview

This repository documents my transition into a data-driven career through consistent practice and project building.

Daily Learning Logs: Tracking 90+ days of progress, documenting challenges, and key learnings.

Consolidated Portfolio: A structured record of my technical growth and hands-on experience.

Career Objective: Building a strong foundation to secure a Paid Internship or Junior Data Analyst role.


# Technical Skill Set:-

Through this journey, I have gained proficiency in:

Spreadsheets: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Query, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, Data Cleaning)

Programming: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Databases: SQL Server, MySQL (Complex Joins, Subqueries, CTEs, Aggregations)

Data Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, Metabase

Documentation and Management: GitHub, Notion, LinkedIn Optimization

# Key Focus Areas

1. Numerical Computing and Manipulation

    NumPy and Pandas: Specialized in array manipulation and handling multi-dimensional data for efficient computation and cleaning.

    Excel Power User: Utilizing Excel as a primary tool for rapid prototyping and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

2. End-to-End Business Intelligence

    Developing interactive dashboards that translate raw data into actionable business insights.

Building full-cycle projects: from SQL extraction to final visualization in Power BI or Tableau.
